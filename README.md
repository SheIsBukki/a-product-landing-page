This was created for learning purposes, as part of the projects in the Freecodecamp Responsive Web Design certification. 
Freecodecamp provided a list of user stories to guide the project, and provided this sample landing page https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks, which I took some inspirations from, particularly the pricing section and the email subscription section. 
I also consulted https://convertkit.com/resources/blog/product-landing-pages, and followed the template showing the 5 essential elements every product landing page should have.

The end product is a product landing page with a similar skeletal layout fromt Convertkit, with Freecodecamp's simplicity and my creative approach to buidling a high fashion landing page.

I designed the brand logo on Canva.
